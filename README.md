## Building DuckDL ##
DuckDL was programmed using Visual Studio 2010, so it is recommended that VS2010 be used to build it. Newer versions of Visual Studio *may* work, but don't expect any sympathy if they fail!

The program is easy to build, just open *DuckDL.sln* with Visual Studio and press **F5**.
